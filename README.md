### PROJECT OVERVIEW
this is a project that is aimed at analysing product and customer review data to generate insight that can guide product inprovement, marketing strategies, and customer engagements.

### ANALYSIS TOOL
I was requested to use excel to execute 
this project and that is what i used.

### DATASET DISCRIPTIOM
The dataset contain information scraped from Amazon Product Pages,
including: product details: name, category ,price ,discount, and rating.
Customer engagement: user reviews, titles,and content. .Each role represents 
a unique product,with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values.

### DATA WRANGLING AND PREPARATION
First of all, read the instrutions and requirement given meticuulously
as this will enable you ascertain what is necessary and what is not.

Having read through thoroughly, i opened the Excel data to commence the cleaning by
removing duplicate rows that are not necessary for the analysis i intend to conduct.

I created a column, new column for main category, considering the fact that i noticed
there are repitition in the content ans separated by a pipe "|" symbol. others column created are S\N 
which was created by specifying a pattern by typing the firdt two numbers and use the fill handle
to automatically fill others. Total pontential revenue was created by multiplying actual price by
rating count, i did for the first row and used fill handle, 
To further clean the dataset i removed the blank space in some columns by clicking on the dropdown filter and
splitted the category columns

At this point i copied all the columns into another sheet.

### ANALYSIS TASKS
Use pivot table and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?

To get this, click on a cell in the table, click on pivot table, select new worksheet
and click ok. Drag category volumn into row area and Discount-percentage into values area in the 
pivot table and summarize values by average. click on a cell in the pivot table and do Alt f1 in the keyboard
to present your work in a chart and format to your satisfaction. then ctrl X to cut and Ctrl V to paste in 
the dashboard. Below is the chart presentation
